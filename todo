DEVIATIONS FROM SPEC

Instead of maintaining local peer connections via hardcoded peers that are "dead"
Every time a new Peerster instance starts up it pings the 3 neighbors with a WANT message
The WANT message creates a new peer, because you obtain enough information to get
a unique place to send the messages.

USEFUL COMMANDS

netstat -anp | grep "peerster"
netstat -anp | grep "udp"
